# Book Recommandation Using Machine Learning

I have developed a Python-based machine learning project focused on recommending books utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and machine learning techniques. In this project, I implemented a robust recommendation system that analyzes user preferences and suggests relevant books based on similar user behaviors.

Following the completion of the recommendation algorithm, I created a Flask API to seamlessly integrate the recommendation system into a web application. This API is designed to receive a book name as input from users and, upon processing the request, it provides a JSON response containing a list of recommended books tailored to the user's interests.

The combination of the KNN algorithm, machine learning, and the user-friendly Flask API ensures an interactive and personalized book recommendation experience for users, enhancing their reading choices and overall satisfaction.
